# Feathercoin

### Built for Everyday Mining

Feathercoin was created to give the everyday miner the ability to mine with their home PC.  While other coins like Bitcoin and Litecoin are ASIC based, Feathercoin is ASIC resistant and built on the NeoScript platform.  This means that you don’t need to have expensive equipment to mine and get involved.  You can mine just the way you are.

### Built for Flexibility

Feathercoin implements many features not seen in the majority of crypto coins. Feathercoin has open source projects for ATM’s, Point of Sales equipment, t-shirt wallets, laser etched physical Feathercoins and Raspberry Pi based projects.

### Built for Community

Feathercoin has been around since 2013 and was born with the idea that you don’t need to be an expert in cryptocurrencies to get involved.  Our community is here to help anyone understand cryptocurrencies, get involved and pull the best ideas into the DNA that makes up Feathercoin.
